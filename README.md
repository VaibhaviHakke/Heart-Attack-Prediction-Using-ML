# Heart Attack Prediction in Youth

This project focuses on predicting heart attacks in young individuals using advanced machine learning techniques.


## Introduction

Heart attacks are becoming increasingly common in young adults due to various lifestyle factors. Early prediction and intervention can save lives and improve quality of life.

## Methodology

We use a combination of data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of heart attacks in youth.

## Results

The model shows promising results with high accuracy and sensitivity in predicting heart attacks.

## Conclusion

Early prediction of heart attacks in young individuals is crucial. Our model provides a reliable tool for healthcare providers to identify at-risk individuals and take preventive measures.
